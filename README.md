# Two-Wheels-Robot-Base

In this task we used an Arduino uno and connected it to an L293D. The L293D is a motor driver that has an H-Bridge an it is used to control two DC motors. The L293D was used because tinkercad does not have L298N. A Slideswitch was used to change the direction of the motors.
